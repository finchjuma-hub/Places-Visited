# Places-Visited

This project is s JavaScript web application designed to track destinations and display their details dynamically. It was built as part of a web development assignment focusing on constructors, prototypes and object driven logic. Each destination is represented as an object with multiple properties e.g location. When a user clicks on a place name, the application reveals its details and a picture. 

## Project Structure
index.html - Main html file with header, container and footer.
style.css - Styling for layout, cards, hover effects and images.
script.js - Contains constructors, prototypes, dynamic rendering.
images - Folder containing place images. 

## Features
Constructor & Prototype: Each place is created using a constructor function with a prototype method.
Dynamic Rendering: Cards are generated dynamically with JavaScript, not hardcored in html.
Interactivity: Clicking a place title toggles visibility of its details and image.
Responsive Styling: Clean card layout with hover effects and image styling.

## Setup 
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure the following fikes exist: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `images folder`
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Adding New Place

## Peer Review Checklist
Do JavaScript objects drive application logic?
Are consrtuctors and prototypes used succesfully?
Are pseudo-coded tests present in the README?
Does the application work as expected?
